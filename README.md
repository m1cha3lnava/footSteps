# footprints


Even as the world around us is increasingly distant and divided, there are threads that keep us connected: our stories. Footprints is a mobile first application leveraging a geo-location API to connect users to those who have gone before. When a user enters a specific area, they are presented with a story from another random user and may in turn leave their own to be discovered by the next visitor.

## Description

As a human being searching for connection and context, I want to learn about the footsteps of those who came before me. When I am within a specific geographic area, I can access a library of diary entries between 200-1000 words left by previous visitors and leave my own story so that I become part of the broader community around me.

Footprints enables users to collect and leave stories known as footprints. These stories are tied to specific locations with the HERE API. Footprints is a bit anti-social network, a bit little-free-library, a bit geocaching, and a bit pokemon go.

Once a user is logged in, they have access to their profile page, where notes they have created and found are stored. They can also see the map which centers on their current location and displays points of interest where new footprints can be found.
